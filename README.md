# fast_and_FOURIERous: Algorithms for Laserhockey Competition (RL Project 24/25)

In the folder [final](./final/) you can find our final code for:
- [SAC_pendulum](./final/SAC_pendulum/) (first attempts of SAC on the Pendulum environment)
- [SAC_hockey](./final/SAC_hockey/) (first attmpts of SAC on the Hockey environment)
- [SAC-RNN2](./final/SAC-RNN2/) (SAC combined with an RNN architecture (on hockey environment))
- [QR-SAC5](./final/QR-SAC5/) (extension of SAC (on hockey environment))
- [SAC-HER](./final/SAC-HER/) (...)
- [SAC-SimBa](./final/SAC-SimBa/) (...)
- [testing](./final/testing/) (examples of how we tested and compared our agents)

Detailed descriptions of the code will be provided via a README.md in the respective folders.
In the [archive](./archive/) folder, you can find older versions of our code. 

Our implementation of SAC (and therefore all of the other algorithms) is based on [this](https://github.com/pranz24/pytorch-soft-actor-critic/tree/master) implementation.
