# fast_and_FOURIERous: Algorithms for Laserhockey Competition (RL Project 24/25)

In the folder final you can find our final code for:
- SAC_pendulum (first attempts of SAC on the Pendulum environment)
- SAC_hockey (first attmpts of SAC on the Hockey environment)
- SAC-RNN2 (SAC combined with an RNN architecture (hockey environment))
- QR-SAC5 (extension of SAC (hockey environment))
- SAC-HER (...)
- SIMBA (...)
- testing (examples of how we tested and compared our agents)

In the archive folder, you can find older versions of our code. 
Detailed descriptions of the code will be provided  via a README.md in the respective folders.

Our implementation of SAC (and therefore all of the other algorithms) is based on [this](https://github.com/pranz24/pytorch-soft-actor-critic/tree/master) implementation.

[Gif mit unserem besten Agent vs strong opp?]

TO DO: 
- check all READMEs 
- is everything clear?
- add how to test an agent? / how to see view statistics?
