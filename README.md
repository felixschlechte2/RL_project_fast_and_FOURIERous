# fast_and_FOURIERous: Algorithms for Laserhockey Competition (RL Project 24/25)

In the folder final you can find our code for:
- SAC_pendulum (first attempts on Pendulum environment)
- SAC_hockey (first attmpts on Hockey environment)
- SAC-RNN (SAC combined with an RNN architecture)
- QR-SAC (extension of SAC)
- SAC-HER (...)
- SIMBA (...)

In the archive folder, you can find older versions of our code. 
Detailed descriptions will be provided in the respective folders.

Our implementation of SAC (and therefore all of the other algorithms) is based on [this](https://github.com/pranz24/pytorch-soft-actor-critic/tree/master) implementation.
